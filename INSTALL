To install the system, follow these steps

Extract the downloaded zip file

We have a number of system dependencies
1. Java 1.6
2. Taverna. Taverna can be downloaded from  http://www.taverna.org.uk/download/workbench/2-4/
3. Xsltproc. This package or something like it http://packages.ubuntu.com/quantal/xsltproc

Before the workflow can be startet, one needs to set the Environment Variable TAVERNA_HOME to the Taverna install folder

Then you need to get the component configs. This is done by cloning the git repo
https://sbprojects.statsbiblioteket.dk/fisheye/git/Medieplatform-config.git
which require login information

You should then export the variable YOUSEE_CONFIG
export YOUSEE_CONFIG=<clone dir of the above git project>


When all these things have been done, you can run the workflow by doing
bin/runWorkflow.sh 2007-12-01

If taverna does not crash, it should return the exit code 0

The results will be found in "Yousee_Ingest_Workfl_output" and is a list of files, without extension. If any failed,
they will have the extension ".error"
